#### ec2ForPoets

The software that runs on ec2ForPoets servers that keeps it updated with the latest versions of River4 etc.  

May also provide the configuration interface down the road a bit. ;-)

#### Updates

##### v0.47 -- 8/23/15 by DW

Added a config.json for setting baseFolder and baseUrl. Allows this app to be used to sync more than just ec2ForPoets installations. 

##### v0.46 -- 8/22/15 by DW

The everyMinute script now runs at the top of the minute. Neatness counts. 

Quits when the mod date of sync.js changes. Will be relaunched by the OS.
